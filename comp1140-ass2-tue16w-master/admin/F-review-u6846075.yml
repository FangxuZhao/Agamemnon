comments:
  - I started reviewing process about two weeks ago. And I have rewrite some parts of the code I mentioned above.
  - However, I noted comments down, here they are.
  - What are the best features of this code?
  - This piece of code is excellent in determining if state is valid. Though it is basic I reckon it is
  - important and each rule is specific and explicit, quite well.
  - Is the code well-documented?
  - Nope. If checking the git log, you'll find the document format is really bad. 3 points here, first he didn't keep
  - the style consistent. I mean "//" and "/**/" format here. Second he missed a lot documents in some functions of
  - specific lines, that makes reviewing quite painful. Third point is poor note, some linguist errors.
  - Fixed now. I have been reviewing and rewriting it. It is much better now.
  - Is the program decomposition (class and method structure) appropriate?
  - Yes. I reckon he did it quite well. The method is consistent with the class.
  - Does it follow Java code conventions (for example, are methods and variables properly named), and is the style consistent throughout?
  - Mostly. However there are some tiny details. See the git log. Some variables should be final and picked out, so you
  - can easily change them for further development.
  - If you suspect an error in the code, suggest a particular situation in which the program will not function correctly.
  - I rewrite most of them and they should work now. One remaining question here,
  - private static boolean isTilesCorrectAmount(ArrayList list, boolean bool) how to imporve?
