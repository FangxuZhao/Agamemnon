## Tutor Comment

Good effort in implementing Agamemnon. Unfortunately, I could not get your `game.jar` file to play a full game of Agamemnon. Understandably, this assignment would have been a greater burden on your team with one member short, so I commend you on completing the assignment short one team member.

I really like the style of the welcome screen - it really matches the theme of Agamemnon. I would suggest not using the board asset with the numbers and pre-placed pieces on there because this isn't an empty board, which really should be what we start the game with.

In terms of code style, I really appreciate you commenting your code in detail. You comments are present where appropriate and are meaningful insights into what your code does. Your project structure for the GUI is a fantastic example of object oriented code. You should try to use this kind of structure for the main Agamemnon game also, rather than just having one big Agamemnon class.

Your testing suite contains useful tests of various aspects of the assignment. Some test classes have meaning class names - you should consistently be using meaningful class names as opposed to "Task7Test" for example.

Overall, I'm very pleased with the work that you have done with this assignment. Congratulations on this achievement.
